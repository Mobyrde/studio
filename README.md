- **AI Opponents**: The game world is populated with AI-controlled snakes that move around dynamically.
- **Score Tracking**: Your score and high score are tracked.
- **AI-Powered Colors**: The color palette for the food is generated by a GenAI model.
- **Neon Aesthetics**: A dark, neon-infused visual style for an immersive experience.

npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:9002` to play the game.
